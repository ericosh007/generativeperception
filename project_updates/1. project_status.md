# GPL Project Status - Source of Truth

## What GPL Is
A demo showing how sensor data (telemetry) can dynamically adjust HDR video processing in real-time. The "Generative" part means it generates optimal HDR parameters from environmental data.

## What's Built
- ✅ **HDR Processing Engine** (`core/processors/hdr_processor.py`)
  - Advanced algorithms: CLAHE, tone curves, color correction
  - Telemetry-driven parameter adjustment
  - ~15ms processing per frame

- ✅ **Telemetry System** (`telemetry/`)
  - Simulated sensors for ambient light, color temp, motion
  - Collectors that gather sensor data
  - Updates 10 times per second

- ✅ **Web Interface** (`main.py`)
  - FastAPI server with WebSocket support
  - HTML interface with controls and displays
  - API endpoints defined

- ✅ **Configuration** (`config/settings.py`)
  - Environment-based settings
  - HDR presets (performance/balanced/quality)
  - Telemetry-to-HDR parameter mappings

- ✅ **Docker Setup**
  - Complete containerization
  - All dependencies included

## What Works Right Now
- Server starts on http://localhost:8000
- Web page loads with buttons and telemetry display
- Telemetry sensors generate data continuously
- HDR processor can enhance frames
- `demo_main.py` can process videos to files

## What Doesn't Work
- **Buttons don't trigger processing** - API not connected to processing logic
- **No video in browser** - WebRTC is just placeholder
- **Processing happens in wrong place** - needs to be in background task

## Sample Videos Available
Located in `data/samples/`:
- Sony Food Fizzle (kitchen/cooking scene)
- Sony Swordsmith (dark forge with fire)
- Sony Whale in Tonga (underwater)
Each has HDR and SDR versions for comparison

## Why It's Built This Way
- **FastAPI**: Async support, WebSockets built-in, modern Python
- **OpenCV**: Industry standard, fast, well-documented
- **Telemetry-driven**: Core innovation - HDR that adapts to environment
- **Docker**: Consistent environment, easy deployment

## What's Left to Do
1. **Connect API to processing** ← Current Task
   - Make `/api/process/start` actually start processing
   - Run processing in background task
   
2. **Add video streaming**
   - Replace WebRTC placeholder with MJPEG stream
   - Send frames to browser
   
3. **Display side-by-side**
   - Show original SDR + enhanced HDR
   - Update JavaScript to handle dual display
   
4. **Polish**
   - Video selection dropdown
   - Processing controls
   - Better error handling

## Next Step
Connect the API endpoint to the video processing logic so clicking "Start" actually does something.
